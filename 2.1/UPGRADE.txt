****************************************************************************************************
*** Note: this only applies to upgrading osCmax v2.5 Beta3 or osCmax v2.5 RC1 to osCmax v2.5 RC2 ***
****************************************************************************************************

1. First, make a backup of both your database and current osCmax files. Should there be any problems, you will be thankful that you took this precaution to roll back your changes.

2. Download the upgrade only package from osCmax.com and extract the zip file to your computer.

3. Upload the new files to your osCmax site. If you have customized any files in your live site excluding your custom template, make sure you do a file-by-file comparison of changes so that your customizations are retianed.

   *** If you have renamed your admin directory, make sure you rename the admin directory before you upload it, so that the new files are uploaded to the correct place on the server. ***

4. Go to your admin panel and login. In the "Adminstrator" menu, click "Upgrade System." If you don't see this option, read Troubleshooting step 3.

5. You will see information regarding your current version and an Upgrade button. 

6. Click the upgrade button. If no errors are printed to the screen, your first upgrade step was completed successfully.

7. Click your Browser's refresh button to reload the upgrade page (DO NOT CLICK THE UPGRADE BUTTON AGAIN!). The upgrade information will change when you refresh the page. 

8. If it is indicated that no further upgrades are needed, you have finished the upgrade process.

9. If it is indcated that you need to run the upgrade script again, click the Upgrade button again. If no errors are printed out to the screen, the database upgrade step was successful.

10. Click your Browser's refresh button to reload the upgrade page (DO NOT CLICK THE UPGRADE BUTTON AGAIN!). The upgrade information will change when you refresh the page. The screen should now display that you are fully upgraded. You have completed the upgrade process.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

1. If you get errors from the upgrade script, chances are you have made changes to the database and will need to manually upgrade your database. Your best option at this point is to visit the forums and post to the Bugs/Problems board. Make sure you include all the errors that are printed to the screen and any custom changes you have made to the database.

===========================
2. If you cannot get your admin panel to load properly to get to the upgrade script after uploading the new version files, don't panic! You can access the upgrade script directly after logging in to your admin by using this url:
http://yourdomain.com/your/admin/upgrade.php

Be sure to substitute your actual domain and actual path in the example url above. Typically all you will need to do in your browser URL bar is replace the file name in the url with upgrade.php.

===========================
3. If you cannot see "Upgrade System" as a menu option in the Administrators menu, go to Administrator >> File Accesss >> Administrator >> Store Files >> upgrade.php

Once you have done that, reload your admin home page and select the administrators menu again. You should now see the "Upgrade System" option.
