    <td><p>The easiest way to start accepting credit card payments through your osCMax store is by using PayPal. You can be set up and accepting credit cards and paypal payments in less than 10 minutes. </p>
      <p>Another big advantage to using PayPal is you do not handle any of the credit card information, so security is enhanced, and you are not liable for any credit card security compliance issues. </p>
      <p>By using this page in your osCMax admin panel to sign up for paypal, you support osCMax as the project earns a small commission for every account we refer to PayPal. </p>
