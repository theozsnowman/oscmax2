osCMax v2.0 (March 2009)
==========================
osCMax v2.0 e-commerce software is a combination of many of the most popular
mods/contributions and osCommerce 2.2 MS2. The credit for the actual mods goes
solely to the original authors of those mods and the many people who update
them. The goal of osCMax is to produce a more complete e-commerce package with
many more features than standard osCommerce.
